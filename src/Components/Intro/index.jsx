							Introduce about <br/>
							myself</h2>
						<p>
						Hello, my name is Wilfried Mambou and I'm delighted to welcome you to my website! I'm a passionate software engineer, with a Master's degree in software engineering from the Protestant University of Central Africa. I'm proud to say that I've been a mentor at OpenClassrooms since 2020, where I've helped several hundred developers to acquire programming skills.

						</p>
						<p>
						Since I started working in the development industry, I have constantly sought to learn new skills and improve my programming abilities. As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience in technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB, which I frequently use to develop modern and scalable web applications. I love DevOps CI/CD, automating builds, testing, and deployments to streamline and enhance development workflows..

						</p>

						<p>
						I believe that web development is a constantly evolving field, and I'm constantly trying to stay informed about the latest technological developments and market trends. I'm also passionate about values such as honesty, respect, and integrity, and I strive to embody these in every aspect of my work. My ultimate goal is to provide high-quality services to all my clients, and contribute to the success of their development projects.

						</p>
						<p>
						I'm happy to offer my skills to you, providing customized solutions to meet all your web development needs. Feel free to contact me to discuss your project!
